  #TASK ONE  Hospital-Data-Monitoring-Archival-System
Section i) and ii) This was worked on by Francis. The code is intended to first extract the text from the log files that are being constantly filled
with data from the python simulators.
This script provides an interactive way to archive system monitoring logs such as heart rate, temperature, and water usage. It allows the user to choose a log file from a numbered menu, then:

Moves the selected log file to a designated archive folder.

Renames the file using a timestamp format: log_type_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.log.

Creates a new empty log file for continued logging.##
